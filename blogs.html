	<h2>06/02/2025 - I hate you Barney</h2>
	<p>I needed something to put here so the blogs page wouldn't be completely empty, so this is the first post.</p>
	<p>When I was a kid, I was apparently really into Barney the Purple Dinosaur. I don't know if it was because I actually liked the show, or because it was the only thing my parents would ever play on the TV. Aside from the knockoff CD of Mamma Mia my mom always put on.</p>
	<p>Well the show was about normal kids show stuff; like sharing is caring, be nice to people etc. Generally I agreed with what Barney said cus it was usually good advice. But one day, he said something that made me question whether or not he was a credible source.</p>
	<p>He said something along the lines of 'Honestly is the best policy'. And he said we shouldn't lie cus we'll just end up lying more. Which is true, yeah. But I didn't believe that we shouldn't lie at all. When I was young, my parents were younger too. And that meant they had a lot more energy to yell at and/or beat me. It happened whenever I screwed up, so lying was a survival instinct back then. And I was extremely good at it.</p>
	<p>Anyway, I initially didn't believe Barney when he said that. Then one day, I left my exercise book at school. I needed it to do my homework. Now, it wasn't a real problem because homework was so easy, I usually just did it right before class anyway (my mom would send me to school a whole hour early). So I wasn't stressing. But then a few hours later, my mom asked if I had done my homework.</p>
	<p>Now, I already had the lie ready in my head. She would ask me this question every day, and I would say yes. And she wouldn't really check if I had done it or not, because if I hadn't, my teacher would snitch on me. And I did my homework every day before class. So, I was all good to lie and get away with it with no real harm done.</p>
	<p>But then I started thinking about what Barney said. What if I told my mom the truth? My first thought was: she'd absolutely beat me with the cane. But then I thought deeper into it. I had lied about everything up until that point. It shaped my identity. If I stopped lying, it would prove that a person like me would be able to change. And if I could change for the better, my mom could too.</p>
	<p>I couldn't imagine someone like my mom changing like that. But if I had a chance to see if it were possible, why wouldn't I try?</p>
	<p>So I was honest with my mom. Honesty is the best policy. I trust you, Barney. I believed he could fix the relationship I had with my mom.</p>
	<p>I told my mom I didn't do my homework, I'd left my exercise book at school. She said OK, wait here. I waited. Wow, this was it. I changed as a person and my mom did too. She actually didn't beat the crap out of me for not doing my homework.</p>
	<p>Then she came back with the cane and beat the crap out of me for not doing my homework.</p>
	<p>Way after that event, I managed to get my hands on the cane she'd used all the time. I hid it away, and told my last big lie: I don't know where the cane is. She stopped beating me after that, and I stopped lying too. Now I'm a terrible liar.</p>
